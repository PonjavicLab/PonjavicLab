# Ponjavic Lab 
  
## Research interests
Cells make our bodies work through a myriad of complex processes that are generally poorly understood, even to this date, and our research focuses on improving the tools we have to visualise these processes. More specifically, our group uses fluorescence microscopy to observe the behaviour of the individual proteins that make up one the most basic components of cells.
